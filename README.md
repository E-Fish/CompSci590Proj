RatePEA:
To run our code, right click on the "index.html" tab on the left side. Then click "Open with Live Server" (Note: This requires the download of the extension "Live Server"). You can also right click on the code in "index.html" itself, and click "Open with Live Server" towards the bottom of the options. 
This will pop open our main "RatePEA" page in chrome.
From there, click on "NewPost" in the top right to take you to the "NewPost" page, or click on any of the course cards populating below to open a "course.html" page.
The search bar towards the top will search courses by their Title, CourseID, or last reviewer. The navbar at the top will sort courses by subject and level.
In our code itself, we have three css files: indexstyle.css, poststyle.css, and courseratingstyle.css. These control the css for index, post, and course, respectively. 
We also have many jave script files (addcourseinfo.js, addcoursereviews.js, addcourses.js, addnewpostdata.js, clickedoncourse.js, filtercourses.js, search.js, server.js, and submitpost.js). These control everything from adding the course cards, to adding adding the course reviews, to filtering the courses. To properly post and retrieve dat to and from mongodb you must install ejs, express, mongoose, and body-parser to the terminal. Then activate server ports 3000 and 4000, by putting the commands node submitpost.js and node retrievepost.js into the terminal. Then run localhost:3000 on chrome.
